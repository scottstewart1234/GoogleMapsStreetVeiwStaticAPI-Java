\t This is an example piece of code to use the google maps street view API in order to create a large dataset of street view images. 
I currently only have the 50 most populus cities in the US configued, but it should work for any location that a google street view
car has been to. The method you're probably intersted in is the "generate image" function, which takes a latitude, longitude, 
file name, and heading.

NOTE: you need an API key. you can get them from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
